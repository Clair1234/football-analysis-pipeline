Pipeline set up to gain interpretable insights of the tactics set up from football matches by analysing positions of players and the ball and a transformer's embedding


## Description
### Abstract
This document serves as a setup guide for a pipeline designed to analyse football tactical patterns using transformer-based machine learning models. The pipeline processes player positional data to extract meaningful tactical insights through embedding analysis and clustering techniques. The system combines spatial analysis, temporal dynamics, and deep learning approaches to identify distinct tactical configurations and team behaviours in football matches.

	Enable mixed precision training (float16) for efficiency
	
	Implement incremental learning with file batching
	
	Monitor loss and RMSE convergence
	
	
	- Feature Extraction:
	
	Generate embeddings from trained transformer model
	
	Calculate spatial features (density, compactness, spread)
	
	Compute movement metrics (distance covered, velocity patterns)
	
	Extract formation characteristics
	
	- Clustering Analysis:
	
	Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
	
	Perform clustering on different feature combinations:
	Positional clustering,
	Per-agent clustering,
	Combined embeddings,
	Hybrid spatial-embedding approach
	
	Generate either field-level or team-level analysis
	
	Evaluate dimension impact

### Accessing outputs
There are two types of outputs that are located in the analysis folder:

**Visualisations:**
Training curves (loss and RMSE plots),
player movement heat maps,
team centroid trajectories,
clustering visualisations (PCA, t-SNE), 
attention maps for model interpretability

**Analysis Results:**
Cluster identification and labelling,
feature importance rankings,
z-score analysis for cluster discrimination,
silhouette scores for clustering quality
