# football-analysis-pipeline
Pipeline set up to gain interpretable insights of the tactics set up from football matches by analysing positions of players and the ball and a transformer's embedding


## Description
### Abstract
This document serves as a setup guide for a pipeline designed to analyse football tactical patterns using transformer-based machine learning models. The pipeline processes player positional data to extract meaningful tactical insights through embedding analysis and clustering techniques. The system combines spatial analysis, temporal dynamics, and deep learning approaches to identify distinct tactical configurations and team behaviours in football matches.

### Keywords

### Run
Those are example of application of code.

### Collect data - run_data_collection.py
```
python run_data_collection.py

```
or there are parameters to collect specific data, policy helps pick a particular policy (all, random, aggresive, defensive, passer, possession, counter), random will always be included, it is the basic GRF action manager. Default is 'random'. The frames parameter is responsible for the number of frames in a match, a frame is 0.1s, default is 5000. The round parameter counts the number of rounds of simulation per policy, default is 100. The parameter output_dir is responsible for where the data is stored once simulated, default is './data/raw'.
```
python run_data_collection.py --policy 'all' --frames 5000 --round 5 --output_dir './data/raw'

```

### Enhance data - run_data_enhancement.py
In main function, change the following line to where the data is stored. The output will be in './data/processed'. 
```
path = './data/raw/' 
```
the run:
```
python run_data_enhancement.py

```

### Run EDA - run_EDA.py
In main function, change the following line to where the data is stored. The output will be in './analysis/EDA/'.
```
path = './data/raw/' 
```
the run:
```
python run_EDA.py

```

### Split into training and testing - run_data_split.py
You can change those parameters in the config at the top:
```
# --- Config ---
source_folder = "./data/processed"
train_folder = "./data/processed/training"
test_folder = "./data/processed/testing"
train_ratio = 0.8  # 80% for training, 20% for testing
seed = 42  # for reproducibility
```
then run:
```
python run_data_split.py

```

### Train a model - run_train_model.py
The parameter `FROM_SCRATCH` is in charge of either creating a new architecture (if True) or loading a model (else). Pick architecture dimension and adapt data folder on line 76:
```
# Collect files available
files = glob.glob('./training/*.parquet')
```
then run:
```
python run_train_model.py
```

### Test a model - run_test_model.py
In main, adapt `model_path` and `data_path` then run:
```
python run_test_model.py

```

### Run analysis - run_tactical_analysis.py
In main, adapt `model_path` and `data_path` then run:
```
python run_tactical_analysis.py

```

### Accessing outputs
There are two types of outputs that are located in the analysis folder:

**Visualisations:**
Training curves (loss and RMSE plots),
player movement heat maps,
team centroid trajectories,
clustering visualisations (PCA, t-SNE), 
attention maps for model interpretability

**Analysis Results:**
Cluster identification and labelling,
feature importance rankings,
z-score analysis for cluster discrimination,
silhouette scores for clustering quality

## Code structure

### Data files
**Input Formats:** CSV and Parquet files containing player positional data.

**Key Data Element for CSV files:**

timestamps for temporal analysis,
team identifiers,
ball position tracking,
match metadata,


**Key Data Element for Parquet files:**
Spatial metrics (density, compactness, spread),
movement patterns (distance covered, velocity),
formation characteristics (hull area, balance metrics),
temporal dynamics (autocorrelation, persistence)
